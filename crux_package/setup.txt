to run the functions in this package, first import:

import sys
sys.path.append(r"C:\Users\patli\Downloads\brainflow")
from crux_package import *

In your case, replace r"C:\Users\patli\Downloads\brainflow" with the path to where every the package is.
So if "crux_package" is in a folder called "Downloads", this should be the path to "Downloads".

After running this, you should be able to call any function in the variable __all__ in __init__.py
